<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Description


Standardized testing has been included in the educational system throughout history and has caused controversy. This type of testing measures a student’s progress at any given time in their education. There are socioeconomic aspects that could impact a student test scores. The purpose of this project is to show how using data could prove or disprove the impact of these socioeconomic influences and thus proving standardized testing is not biased or unbiased. The impact could be negative, positive, or nothing. 
The methods used was Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. Linear regression and random forest regressor models were used from Supervised machine learning models in Sklearn.
