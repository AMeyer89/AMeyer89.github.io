  <h3 align="center">TRAFFIC SIGN CLASSIFICATION</h3>

  <p align="center">
	With the major advancements in self driving cars and smart cars has given way to a new classification problem for identifying traffic signs. The self-driving cars require the ability to know the current speed limit, stop signs, etc. Also, some car manufacturers can use a classification system to identify the traffic sign and notify the driver. 
	Convolutional neural networks or ConvNets are a great way to classify images and thus can be used to classify traffic signs (3).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Description


This project demonstrates how to use a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Cars have come a long way and require traffic sign detection. Convolutional neural networks or ConnvNets are a great way to classify images and thus can be used to classify traffic signs. The data used was preprocessed German traffic signs that were saved into the nine pickle files (6). The dataset has 43 types of signs, classes. Training subset contains 86989 images, validation subset contains 4410 images and testing subset contains 12630 images. The model was validated using accuracy.  The results showed that the model performed well with a testing accuracy of more than 77%. All models used the same parameters, but different filter dimensions of 3 X 3, 5 X 5, 9 X 9, and 13 X 13. The classification accuracy equal to 89.6%, 82.9%, 80.1% and 77.8 %
