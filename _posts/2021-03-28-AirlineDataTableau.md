<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Description

Airplanes are one of the safest ways of transportation. The likelihoods of perishing in an airline accident are about one in 11,000,000 (1). People are more probable to be struck by lightning, with a one in 13,000 chance for a lifetime. 
Fatalities do happen, but media outlets make society more aware of them, so people tend to think they happen all the time. From 1982 and 2010, 3,288 people in the U.S. died from airplane related causes (1). That comes out to about 110 fatalities per year which include all flight types (military, private, commercial, etc.).  Boeing came out and said that fatal accidents occurred once every 200,000 flights in the 50s and 60s (1). Currently they have gotten better with only occur once every two million flights (1).
Lastly it is essential to understand that typically aviation incidents are not fatal. Some examples are airplanes lose altitude, slide off the runway, and hit extreme turbulence without any injuries (1). There is a 95 percent chance of survival in an airline accident according to the National Transportation Safety Board (1).
